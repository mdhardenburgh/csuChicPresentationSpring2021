# Introduction and Motivation
The motivation for this presentation is based upon my own experience from 
CSCI 430 when I took it in the spring of 2019. My group wanted to create a smart
clock. We needed a user interface framework and a python framework called Kivy 
was chosen. The Kivy framework was OK, but Qt has more features, better 
documentation and Qt is used significantly more in industry. I have chosen to 
give a presentation on Qt to teach students a framework that is used in industry. 

I have created this repo to contain my presentation materials and code used 
in the demonstration. It is available for all to clone and use in thier 
projects, provided the GPL license is followed. The goal is for students to 
clone the repo, reverse engineer, understand and try things out for themselves.

# Why User Interfaces Anyway?
A well designed user interface makes interacting with software programs easier,
more appealing and faster. I also belive that a well designed user interface
makes it easier to communinicate information.

# Why Qt specifically then?
- Qt is used by many companies
- Qt supports both Python and C++, 
- Qt is has an open source and commercial closed source lisence buisness model
- The Qt framework is multiplatform. Qt applications can be developed on 
  Windows, Mac, or Linux and deployed on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android. 
- Qt supports multiple processor architectures from 32-bit ARM microcontrollers 
  up to x86 Intel and AMD destop PCs.

# Demonstration
I will be demonstrating a "Smart Coffee Machine" as an example project. In the 
past for the CSCI 430 Software Engineering class there have been a few hardware
projects such as "Smart Mirrors" and "Smart Clocks" for which a user interface
was required.
